## He/Him/Jim

I am a Data Scientist in the Data Science Research team at [Smart Data Foundry](https://smartdatafoundry.com/), Edinburgh. 

I'm a big **R** fan, with an interest in software development and Data Engineering. 

I take great pleasure in eliminating friction at work and encouraging people to share practices where it feels right.

I am a collaborator on the [lambdr](https://github.com/mdneuzerling/lambdr) R package. **lambdr** is an R runtime for _AWS Lambda_, making it possible to deploy R code as containerised _Lambda_ functions.

My side project is working through the backend engineering course at [boot.dev](boot.dev).
